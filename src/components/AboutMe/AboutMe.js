      <h3> Nanny Helper was created by nannies for nannies. </h3>

      <p> My mission is to help create a safer work environment for all caregivers. Oftentimes families don’t really think of themselves as employers and don’t think about what it means to take on a full time staff member like a nanny or mother’s helper. Our goal is to create a safe environment for caregivers to talk about their experiences and journey. I have heard many horror stories from other caregivers and I even have a few of my own to share. With a safe place to rate families we can talk to each other and let them know about our time with that family and how they treated us because references are not just important to employers but also important to employees. </p>
