## Planning Story

I started wanting to find a way to help some of my friends in the childcare circle. We often share stories of mistreatment, poor pay, and unfair termination with no way to communicate this to the next caregiver of that family. Often the reasoning a nanny left a position was ‘to go back to school’ or a career change but we never truly know and we have no way to contact them. They are allowed to ask for references for us but we often don't get them from their previous childcare providers. I thought that the best way to support this community was to create an app where they can share their experiences about the families they’ve cared for, good and bad, and the beginnings of NannyHelper was born! I thought of what I thought would be good criteria to review a family on and then reached out to other caregivers that I knew and asked them of their opinions. Quickly I was able to see the basics of a review form building. I then thought of the abilities I wanted users and non users alike to be able to do within my app. Finding the importance of whether or not someone should be able to find a family without being logged in and what would be the most beneficial to child care providers. Once my user stories were done I began wireframing and rough sketches for what the website and resources should look like. Then I started breaking down the project into smaller pieces and using a project board, ZenHub, to manage all of the steps I need to take. Finally, I began to code….Let the games begin.
